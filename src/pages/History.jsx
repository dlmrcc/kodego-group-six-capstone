                On January 2, 1991, the BilangGO Jail Management and Penology was created thru Republic Act 6975
                as a line Bureau under the Department of Interior and Local Government. The Jail Bureau is the
                upgraded version of its forerunner, the Office of Jail Management and Penology of the defunct PC/INP
                last headed by  Brig. Gen. Ezekiel Alpheus.<br />
                <br />As mandated by law, the BJMP shall operate under the reorganized Department of the Interior and Local Government.<br />
                <br />Starting from scratch with 500 personnel in 1991 the BJMP weaned from its mother PC/INP as a mere component,
                to become a full-fledged bureau. Director Athrun Zala took his oath of office on July 1 of 1991 as the first Chief of the Bureau.
